# Leetcode practice

  This repository is created to store the problems solved on LeetCode, along with their solutions and reflections. 
  
  The problems are categorized into three levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, and each problem is mapped to its corresponding LeetCode problem number.

  The goal is to solve either three Easy problems or one Easy problem and one Medium problem every week.
