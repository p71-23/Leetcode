This repository serves as a record of my LeetCode coding exercises, including problem descriptions, solutions, and annotations.

The problems are sourced from [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/) and are primarily solved using the C/C++ programming language within the LeetCode editor.

The problems are categorized into three folders: Easy, Medium, and Hard. Each folder contains individual files named with the problem number and name format: "ProblemNumber_ProblemName".

The file content begins with a "#" followed by the problem's description and examples. It is then followed by the code, comments, and the thought process for the solutions.

A new branch is created each week named "weekN_20xx/xx", indicating the week number and specific dates of the exercise.The changes are merged into the main branch and synchronized with the local repository on Sundays.

## For Windows Users
1. Make sure you have an appropriate compiler installed on the Windows system. You can choose to use Visual Studio Build Tools or CodeBlocks (which comes with GCC).
2. If you choose to use Visual Studio Build Tools, refer to the official documentation for downloading and installation instructions.
   If you choose to use CodeBlocks, you can download the latest version from the official website and follow the installation wizard.
3. Open your code file in CodeBlocks and click the compile and run.
   
## For Mac Users
1. Make sure you have Xcode Command Line Tools installed on your Mac. If not, you can install them by running the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. In the terminal, navigate to your local repository folder.
3. Use the following commands to compile and run the code:
   ```
   gcc file_name.c -o executable_name
   ./executable_name
   ```
   
## For Linux Users
1. In the terminal, install an appropriate compiler using the package manager. Common choices include GCC, Clang, or LLVM.
    You can install GCC using the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install gcc
     ```
2. In the terminal, navigate to your local repository folder.
3. Use the following commands to compile and run the code:
   ```
   gcc file_name.c -o executable_name
   ./executable_name
   ```
   
You can use the search bar in the upper right corner to find specific problem numbers or descriptions to query the corresponding solution process. If you discover any incorrect solutions or thought processes, please contact me at qianyi0830@163.com. Thank you.

Happy hacking!
